## Project status

Warning: This project is still under alpha development and should not be used in production or relied upon for missions critical projects.

## Introduction

Backdoor.io is a generic purpose system administration client and server application.

It aims to provide a common approach and user interface for various applications, servers or systems.

In the ideal scenario, someone could connect to his own backdoor.io client and manage many diverse systems with less effort and confusion.

Finaly, a system that would expose it functions through backdoor.io would do so with a common api and by coding only a "web service" layer. There would be no need to code a custom user interface.
